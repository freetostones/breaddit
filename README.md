# breaddit

A simple attempt at a Reddit clone with a twist! This is built for XAMPP using PHP & MySQL for CSIT 337 @ Montclair State University.

Big shoutout to @datanotfound for the help!

## How do I run it?

So this site was designed to work XAMPP so you will need that to run it without much hassle. Just `git clone` the repository into your `htdocs/xampp/` directory and you should be fine. Add the dump of the database to make sure it actually works.

## Other notes

If you log into the site with the username `admin` you will have access to the ability to delete topics and replies.

You also have to have a SQL user name `breaddit` that has `password` as its password if you dont want to change things in the `connect.php` file.
